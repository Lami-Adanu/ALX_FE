Rename repo and make git main instead of master

🧩 Auto-Rename Script for Any Repo

Run these commands inside your project folder (the one already linked to GitHub):

# 1️⃣ Rename the local branch from master → main
git branch -m master main

# 2️⃣ Push the renamed branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# 3️⃣ Change the default branch name for all future git init commands
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# 4️⃣ (Optional) Delete the old master branch from GitHub
git push origin --delete master

🧠 What This Script Does
Step	Command	What It Does
1️⃣	git branch -m master main	Renames your current branch locally
2️⃣	git push -u origin main	Uploads the new branch to GitHub
3️⃣	git config --global init.defaultBranch main	Ensures all new repos start with main
4️⃣	git push origin --delete master	Removes the old master branch remotely (optional but clean)
🪄 Tip:

After running it, open your GitHub repo → Settings → Branches → confirm the default branch is now main.
If it’s not, just switch it manually there once — future pushes will automatically align with it.
